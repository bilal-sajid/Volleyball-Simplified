      term: "Rotation Overview",
      description: 
      `Players rotate clockwise through the six zones whenever their team gains the serve. This ensures all players experience each position on the court.\n
      The zones and rotation sequence:\n\n
      Zone 1: Back-right (server)\n
      Zone 6: Back-center\n
      Zone 5: Back-left\n
      Zone 4: Front-left\n
      Zone 3: Front-center (middle blocker zone)\n
      Zone 2: Front-right (right-side hitter zone)\n\n
      Example: Start serving in Zone 1, rotate through Zones 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and come back to Zone 1 after a full cycle.`,
